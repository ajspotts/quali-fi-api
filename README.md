#Quali-Fi API

Quali-Fi is an application for employers to vet top applicants.  The application works with two different models of data: openings & applicants.  The goal of this project is for the Rails API portion to serve up JSON.  We built the front end portion of the application with AngularJS; see the repo here: https://github.com/ihollands/Quali-Fi
